👋 Hi, Yu here
- 
- 👀 I’m an avid cyclist (FTP 280, PWR 4.16), nak muay (since 2018), and mechanical keyboard enthusiast (no RGB plz).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++.
- 📫 You can reach me at yuxingyuehsing@gmail.com and/or https://www.linkedin.com/in/yxing9/

⭐️ Why switched track from IR to CS?
  - Coding is an invaluable skill to have. I canot imagine living my entire life without knowing how forces moving our time work and not being part of it.
  - Currently garnering ideas to apply computer science to the field international relations. Welcome to hit me up with any idea!
